## Roadmap
* Add `wire:append` for appending DOM changes rather than replacing them
* Refine the "asset_url" config. Potentially change to "app_url" (https://github.com/livewire/livewire/pull/1693)
* Support multiple pagination (https://github.com/livewire/livewire/pull/1997)
* A CSP-safe mode for Livewire (https://github.com/livewire/livewire/pull/2485#issuecomment-784355989)
* Add `$wire.errors()` type deal
